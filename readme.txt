== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to pay for extra traffic? =

No. All download-requests are handled by our servers.

= Why doesn't the mp3 download start immediately? =

Downloading the video as mp3 is way more complicated than just downloading the plain video. We have to fetch the video to our servers and convert the video. These are time-consuming processes, because of this we are caching mp3 files. If a video has already been converted we will allow your users to download the converted mp3 without waiting. A mp3 file will actually be cached for 1 month since the last request.

= Can I decide the Video Quality? =

No. The video download functionality is pretty new and has just reached ALPHA stadium. Our service will choose the best quality available under consideration of our own load. If our servers are overloaded we won't be able to serve the best quality and will serve normal quality. We are trying to avoid low quality as best as we can by adding new servers to our cluster.

= Is your service free? =

Yes.

= Why is it free? = 

Because we are awesome.. :-)

= Will there ever be any pop ups, layers or anything similar on your site? =

No. These ads totally suck, we hate them at least as much as you do ;-)

= How can I help you? =
